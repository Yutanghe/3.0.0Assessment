<title>  Project: Emotional Input Technology (EIT)   </title>

<body>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Emotion has already been inputted in various ways.
But spending effort to input emotions result in breaking the immersion. For example, when a story game asks how the player feel with four choices, angry, sad, happy, and neutral and then the story moves on in the selected branch.
Scientist has already developed technologies that can read emotions much more accurately. Therefore, it is possible to implemented them in existing applications.

This project aims to create new method of inputting emotions using new technology. 
First, I cover my motivation, explaining EIT’s usefulness and highlights various possible implementation to the current applications. And then conduct a detailed description of the features and services of the product. Next, a description, detailing the software, hardware, and other relevant source of tools as appropriate. Then listing the required skills, including software that needs to be written, and special hardware and their feasibility. Lastly discuss the possible outcome of the product upon success.
</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>EIT would be very useful and can be implemented to a lot of applications today.

Immersion of video games might dramatically change by Input emotion technology. For example, EIT reads happy emotions from the player, the input is sent to the video game machine and the game automatically select the storyline according to the player’s emotion.

Implementation was for patients of psychological stress. For example, EIT monitoring patient’s emotion constantly, giving marks average emotion of the day and give advice or warning when emotion is overwhelmingly negative.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The important main features of EIT are the effortless, speed, perpetuality and accuracy of delivering.

Effort to deliver is the most important of all features.
Inputting emotions have already been used today in video games. For example, A story game asks player to select sad, angry, or lonely when a character died. In this example, the player will need to spend lots of effort to make up their decision (not to mention that the choices are limited, and it is highly inaccurate). Effortless to deliver user’s emotion will allow the player to stay immersed to the game.

Speed of delivering the second most important feature. 
Emotions are often unpredictable. Accurate emotions need to be captured in real time. It is comparable to observing how a person react during a film as supposed to asking a person how he feel after a horror movie, and the data could be 90% of the people experienced fear as supposed to an unreliable movie review. A speedy of delivering made capturing a person’s emotion at present increasing its usability in real time applications.

Perpetuality is the most important of all features. 
Emotions continuously changes and it for example, a person had a good day in the morning then in the afternoon he sprains his leg. Asking how this person’s day you will receive negative response. Perpetuality is the other factor that helps capture a person’s emotion at present increasing its usability in real time applications.

Accuracy is the last of the important features of EIT.
Emotions is hard to describe, we are simply limited in the words that we use to describe emotions. For example, the emotion was described by words like little sad, very happy, instead we could be measurable data like 20% raise in heart rate. Using words to describe a person’s emotions is highly inaccurate but by detecting useful data, we can more accurately describe or predict a person’s emotion. 
</p>

<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p>Any hard wares that can detect changes in a human body has the potential need for EIT.
For example, heart rate detector is useful to detect the stress level.
</p>

<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p>Software engineer is required to develop software that can transform the data collected from hardware into usable data. 
</p>


<h2>SOutcome</h2>
<p>The outcome of the successful project will improve the user experiences significantly.
