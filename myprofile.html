<h2>Interest in IT</h2>

<p>My interest in IT for its complexity and the satisfaction of solving problem. My interest in IT starts after working at various industries. At the mechanic workshop, I have realised that I love the sensation of solving problem. 
I studied IT for 2 years after year 12 graduation. At the time I found IT fun. However, At the time I choose work instead of finishing the study.
I choose RMIT because it was more flexible than the university I previously been to.
I expect growth in my personal and interpersonal skills.
